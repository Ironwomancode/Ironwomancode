- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ironwomancode
- 👀 I’m interested in applying my knowledge of improving processes and my mindset is not only for one mission but how for achieving what is impossible.
- 🌱 I’m currently developying Python, CSS, Html, Javascript, UI Design, Unity, C#, React Native, Django and others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to demonstrate on some of the projects done from my last two years of experience.
